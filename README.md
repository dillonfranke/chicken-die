## How to Play (On Your Turn)
On your turn, you must complete the following steps in order:

### Step 1: Collect Eggs
Collect 1 Egg Card from the supply for each Hen Card you have in your flock. (Chicks do not produce eggs).

### Step 2: Draw a Card
Draw the top card from the Draw Pile and add it to your hand.

### Step 3: Play Action Cards (Optional)
You may play any number of Action Cards from your hand. Follow the instructions on each card. See "Action Card Types" below for examples!

### Step 4: Cash in Eggs (Optional)
You may spend your Egg Cards to perform the following actions, as many times as you can afford:
*   **Spend 3 Eggs:** Draw 1 card from the Draw Pile.
*   **Spend 6 Eggs:** Take 1 Chick Card from the supply and add it faceup to your flock.

### Step 5: Roll the "Chicken Die!"
You must roll the 6-sided Chicken Die and immediately resolve its effect.

## The Chicken Die! Outcomes
*   **(Roll a 1) Collect an Egg!** Take 1 Egg Card from the supply.
*   **(Roll a 2) Promote an Egg!** Choose one Egg Card from your hand and replace it with a Chick Card from the supply. If you have no Eggs (e.g., you only have Chicks), this roll has no effect.
*   **(Roll a 3) Promote a Chick!** Choose one Chick Card from your flock and replace it with a Hen Card from the supply. If you have no Chicks (e.g., you only have Hens), this roll has no effect.
*   **(Roll a 4) Demote a Chick!** Choose one Chick Card from your flock and replace it with an Egg Card from the supply. If you have no Chicks (e.g., you only have Hens), this roll has no effect.
*   **(Roll a 5) Demote a Hen!** Choose one Hen Card from your flock and replace it with a Chick Card from the supply. If you have no Hens (e.g., you only have Chicks), this roll has no effect.
*   **(Roll 6) A Chicken Dies!** Sad day. You must choose one chicken from your flock (either a Chick, Hen, or Specialty Chicken) and place it into the Supply (or Chicken Graveyard if a Specialty Chicken).

## Action Card Types
Here are the types of cards you might find in the Draw Pile.

### 1. Specialty Chicken Cards
These cards are chickens, but they have special rules. Some can remain hidden in your hand until you need them!
*   **Dino Chicken:** Place in your flock. Cannot be killed by predators.
*   **Flying Chicken:** Place in your flock. Can't be stolen.
*   **Mad Scientist Chicken:** Place in your flock. Can be discarded to prevent disease from affecting your chickens.
*   **Robo-Hen:** Place in your flock. Produces 2 eggs instead of 1 during Step 1.
*   **Decoy Chicken:** Place in your flock. It doesn’t lay eggs, but an opponent must choose to kill the rubber chicken before any of your other chickens.
*   **Punk Rock Chick:** This chick refuses to "sell out" and can never be promoted to a Hen. However, it's so independent that it produces 1 Egg at the start of your turn, just as if it were a Hen.

### 2. Protection Cards
These cards are used to save your flock from harm.
*   **Immunity:** Play this to protect one of your chickens that would die from any source.
*   **Chicken Wire:** Play to stop a predator card such as “Coyote Attack”.
*   **Cock Block:** Play when an opponent targets you with an Attack card. It cancels the card and ends their Play Action Cards step immediately.

### 3. Attack Cards
These cards are played on your turn to mess with your opponents. If a chicken dies the attacker chooses which chicken.
*   **Coyote Attack:** Choose an opponent. One of their chickens dies.
*   **Chicken Blaster:** Choose an opponent. Target one of their chickens to die.
*   **Die-Die-Die!** Choose an opponent. They must immediately roll the Chicken Die 3 times in a row. They can only be affected by negative outcomes (demotions and chicken dying).
*   **Hen Swap:** Swap all of your Hens (even if 0) with an opponent's Hens. Receive up to 3 hens.
*   **3-Egg Omelette:** Destroy 3 Egg Cards from any one player.
*   **Infertility:** Place on one of an opponent’s hens to permanently prevent it from laying eggs.
*   **Eat Mor Chikin:** Play this card on your turn to target an opponent; one of their chickens is immediately eaten (discarded). As a bonus for "satisfying the customer," you may skip your "Roll the Chicken Die!" step at the end of your turn.

### 4. Instant Effect Cards
These cards affect all players, including you! These cards come into effect the moment they are drawn from the draw pile. There is a max of 3 chicken deaths per person.
*   **Demotion:** All Hens currently in play are replaced with Chicks.
*   **Foster Farms:** All Hens currently in play die. Does not affect Specialty Chickens.
*   **Bird Flu:** All Chicks currently in play die. Does not affect Specialty Chickens.
*   **Fox on the Loose:** Starting with you and going in turn order, every player must roll the Chicken Die 2 times.
*   **Chicken Assassin:** Each player must choose one of their Specialty Chickens to die.
*   **Chicken Bomb:** The player who draws this card must choose one of their chickens to die.

### 5. Personal Growth Cards
These cards provide a benefit only to you.
*   **Feeding Frenzy:** All of your Chicks are immediately promoted to Hens (max 3).
*   **Incubator:** You may trade 2 Egg Cards for 1 Chick from the supply. You can do this to receive up to 3 chicks.
*   **Farm to Table:** Collect 3 Egg Cards from the supply.
*   **Resurrection:** Take one chicken from the Chicken Graveyard and add it to your flock.

### 6. Turn Altering Cards
These cards manipulate the flow of the game or your turn.
*   **Take it or Leave it:** Play just before you roll the die. After you roll, you may choose to ignore the outcome.
*   **End Your Turn:** Play this at any point during Steps 1-4 to immediately end your turn without rolling the Chicken Die.
*   **Reverse:** You do not roll the die. The order of play is now reversed.

## Winning the Game
When a player loses their last chicken, they are out of the game.
Play continues until only one player has chickens left in their flock.
That player is the **WINNER!**
