**Step 3: Play Action Cards (Optional)**
You may play any number of Action Cards from your hand. Follow the instructions on each card.

**Step 4: Cash in Eggs (Optional)**
You may spend your **Egg Tokens** to perform the following actions, as many times as you can afford:
*   **Spend 3 Eggs:** Draw 1 card from the **Draw Pile**.
*   **Spend 6 Eggs:** Take 1 **Chick Card** from the supply and add it faceup to your flock.

**Step 5: Roll the "Chicken Die!"**

*   **(1 side) Promote!:** Choose one **Chick Card** from your flock and replace it with a **Hen Card** from the supply. If you have no Chicks, this roll has no effect.
*   **(1 side) Roll Again!:** Lucky you? You must immediately roll the die again and resolve the new outcome.
*   **(1 side) Draw a Card!:** Draw the top card from the **Draw Pile**.
*   **(1 side) Collect an Egg!:** Take 1 **Egg Token** from the supply.

## Action Card Types

### 1. Specialty Chicken Cards
*These cards are chickens, but they have special rules. Some can remain hidden in your hand!*
*   **Dino Chicken:** Keep in your hand. Can be revealed and discarded to prevent one of your chickens from being killed by a predator.
*   **Flying Chicken:** Keep in your hand. Can be revealed and discarded to prevent one of your chickens from being stolen.
*   **Mad Scientist Chicken:** Keep in your hand. Can be revealed and discarded to prevent a disease from affecting your chickens.
*   **Robo-Hen:** Place in your flock. Produces 2 eggs instead of 1 during Step 1.
*   **Decoy Chick:** Place in your flock. If an opponent's card would cause one of your chickens to die, you must choose the **Decoy Chick** as the target.

### 2. Protection Cards
*These cards are used to save your flock from harm.*
*   **Immunity:** Play when one of your chickens would die from any source to prevent it.
*   **Chicken Wire:** Play to cancel a predator card (e.g., “Coyote Attack”).
*   **Cock Block:** Play when an opponent targets you with an Attack card. It cancels their card and immediately ends their "Play Action Cards" step.

### 3. Attack Cards
*These cards are played on your turn to mess with your opponents.*
*   **Coyote Attack:** Choose an opponent. One of their chickens dies.
*   **Die-Die-Die!:** Choose an opponent. They must immediately roll the Chicken Die 3 times in a row.
*   **Hen Swap:** Swap one of your Hens with an opponent's Hen.
*   **Bird Flu:** Choose an opponent. All of their Chicks (not Hens) die.
*   **Omelette:** Destroy 3 **Egg Tokens** from any one player.
*   **Infertility:** Place on an opponent’s Hen. That Hen no longer produces eggs during Step 1.

### 4. World Altering Cards
*These cards affect all players, including you!*
*   **Demotion:** All Hens currently in play are replaced with Chicks.
*   **Foster Farms:** All Hens currently in play die.
*   **Drought:** Announce "Drought." Until the start of your next turn, no players collect eggs during Step 1.
*   **Fox on the Loose:** Starting with you and going in turn order, every player must roll the Chicken Die 2 times.

### 5. Personal Growth Cards
*These cards provide a benefit only to you.*
*   **Feeding Frenzy:** All of your Chicks are immediately promoted to Hens.
*   **Incubator:** Spend any number of your **Egg Tokens**. For every 2 Eggs you spent, take 1 Chick from the supply.
*   **Farm to Table:** Collect 3 **Egg Tokens** from the supply.
*   **Resurrection:** Take up to 2 chickens from the Discard Pile and add them to your flock.

### 6. Turn Altering Cards
*These cards manipulate the flow of the game.*
*   **Take it or Leave it:** Play just before you roll the die. After you roll, you may choose to ignore the outcome.
*   **End Your Turn:** Play this at any point during Steps 1-4 to immediately end your turn without rolling the Chicken Die.
*   **Reverse:** The order of play is now reversed. You do not roll the die this turn.

## Winning the Game

When a player loses their last chicken, they are **out of the game**.
Play continues until only one player has chickens left in their flock.

**That player is the WINNER!**
